## Feedback
Throughout the Car Sharing project, I have gained valuable knowledge and skills in several areas. Firstly, I learned the basics of SQL and got hands-on experience working with the H2 database. This allowed me to understand how to store and retrieve data efficiently for the car-sharing service.

Additionally, the project introduced me to advanced Java features such as Collections. I learned how to manipulate and manage data structures effectively, which proved essential in developing the functionality of the program.

While working on the project, I encountered various difficulties, such as designing the database schema and implementing complex algorithms. However, through persistence and problem-solving, I was able to overcome these challenges and achieve the desired outcomes.

Overall, the Car Sharing project has been an excellent learning opportunity for me as a Java Backend Developer. It provided practical experience in working with databases, utilizing advanced Java features, and developing a comprehensive program. I am grateful for the knowledge and skills gained throughout this project.
